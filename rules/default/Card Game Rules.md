##THE GAME
Spritemania is a two player card game that plays like a Retro video game.
You play through levels accumulating points which are added up at the end to give you your Highscore and if it's the highest you are the winner. PowerUps play a large role in the game, these are your buff/debuff cards which come in three forms Offensive, Defensive and Neutral.
Last of all the game uses credits (coins) to begin play and also throughout the game and free lives can be attained for reaching certain scores mid level.
We look forward to you playing this game and giving us feedback on how it plays.

##GAMEOVER (End Game)
The game finishes when any one player runs out of Sprite cards & credits to use. 
The winner is decided by the amount of levels won, if this number is the same for both players then their Highscores are used to break the tie.

##REQUIREMENTS TO PLAY
Two decks of 52 playing cards (1 per player) minus Jokers (40 Number cards, 12 Picture cards)
3 Coins or tokens to be used for credits.
Paper & Pen for score keeping.

##CARD TYPES
###“Sprite” Cards (Number Cards X 40)
Sprite cards are the main playing cards used in this game. Each player starts a level with 10 sprite cards to use. Each card has a number in the top corner from 1 - 10 (1 being A when a poker deck is used) these numbers represent the attack/defence number of this card. When cards are STACKED (see below) all the cards in a single row are added to up to get a total attack /defence score.

**Attacking** is done by moving one's row  directly across the board to attack your opponents row, the winner is determined by the added up numbers of the cards and the effects of any powerups in play. If the row to be attacked is vacant it's an instant win. Defeated cards are considered deleted and are placed to the players left whilst winning cards are placed to the right of the player and are called saved cards.

**Stacking Cards**  will expose the card before it (unless a PowerUp prevents this). So if you have 3 rows of 1card each in them face down and you choose to stack a card in row one you will be required to turn over the 1st card but the 2nd remains face down, if you do this again with row 1 the first 2 will be face up and the last one face down.


**Use the cards in all suits from A - 10**

- A = 1000 pts
- 2 = 900 pts
- 3 = 800 pts
- 4 = 700 pts
- 5 = 600 pts
- 6 = 500 pts
- 7 = 400 pts
- 8 = 300 pts
- 9 = 200 pts
- 10 = 100 pts

###“PowerUp” Cards (Picture Cards X 12)

Description:
PowerUp cards are the buff/debuff cards used in this game.
These cards can be placed without losing your turn, so you could stack a card then put a powerup on the same turn or place down a PowerUp then attack. If a PowerUp is placed on a facedown card the PowerUp remains face down as well and only turned over if the Sprite card is. 
Use the Jacks, Queens and Kings in all suits:
#####Jacks = Defensive Cards         
- J Clubs = Shield makes one card impervious to attack once but only in defence, card remains on the table regardless of the outcome. If attacked and your cards win card still remains on table and points are paid accordingly
- J Hearts = Health Potion gives a card a defensive attack of 10 when attacked but remains its   printed number when used to attack.
- J Spades = Mines insta kills the opposing player's card when attacked. If placed on the 2nd card will destroy the opponent's 2nd card.
- J Diamonds = Build Allows you to create a fourth row

#####Queens = Neutral
- Q Clubs = Score Multiplier doubles cards points score on a winning hand only.
- Q Hearts = Resurrect Bring back one card from the played pile.
- Q Spades = No Clip Allows the user to select an opponent's row to expose.
- Q Diamonds = Bonus Points The card this is placed on scores regardless of outcome.

#####Kings = Offensive
- K Clubs = Bomb Wins any attack move from the user regardless of the cards only in - offence. Burns all of the cards from both sides. 
- K Hearts = Directional Fire Allows a row to attack diagonally either right or left.
- K Spades = Sniper allows the player to eliminate one their opponents visible cards.
- K Diamonds = Infinite ammo maxes out one of you cards to 10 in offence score remains as displayed on the card.
